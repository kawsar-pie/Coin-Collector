# Coin-Collector
## Description
A fox and a coin appear on the screen. You use the arrow keys to move the fox toward the coin. When the fox touches the coin, you get ten points, and another coin appears somewhere else. The game ends after seven seconds and the final score is displayed.

The game starts by setting the score to zero. If there is time left, the fox can move around and collect coins. When the time is up, the game ends and the final score is displayed on the screen.
